                    Feyre's survival rests upon her ability to hunt and kill â€“ the forest
                    where she lives is a cold, bleak place in the long winter months. So

                    resist fighting it for the flesh. But to do so, she must kill the
                    predator and killing something so precious comes at a price ...
